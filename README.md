# Proton Mail Sieve Filters
With my effort to de-Google my life, I've decided to move to Proton. Proton is not unique in offering strong email filtering
and sorting with their service. However, unlike Gmail or such, they offer the ability for you to create sieve filters and
upload them directly using your account management.

These filters are my own of course, and they fit the needs for my mailbox, and I'm going to be constantly refining them and
polishing them to wrangle my email mess. If you find them useful, go ahead and take them. Maybe you can wrangle your email
a bit more effectively and draw some inspiration from this setup!
